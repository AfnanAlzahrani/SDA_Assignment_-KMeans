> * In addition to supervised techniques, there are a number of uses for unsupervised learning. What if we have a dataset without labels? What if we want to find patterns but we are not exactly sure what we are looking for? We can use unsupervised learning in these scenarios. One of the most commonly used techniques in unsupervised learning is K-Means Clustering. Machine Learning practitioners will often use K-Means Clustering as the first model they apply when solving clustering tasks in order to get an idea of the structure of the dataset. This model is also considered one of the most robust methods even for image segmentation and image annotation. Even though K-Means can be used for these more advanced applications, it is still considered to be very simple and easy to implement. The high-level idea is to identify natural groupings within a dataset without reference to labels or outcomes.
